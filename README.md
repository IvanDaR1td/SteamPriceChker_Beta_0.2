# SteamPriceChker-Beta 0.2
### This program is a immediate thought someday that I thought: I wanna improve the basic Steam price checker that I did 3 years ago.
### So for this program, I redesigned the whole structure and logic.
## For now, what does the program do?
    1. when launched the program, user can search the game/ gameid in a basic GUI to find the game.
    2. while find the game that user want, user can select the game and press track buttonto track it via Discord server bot.
    3. When the game that user tracked dropped the price, the bot will notice immediately and notice the price drop rate as well.
## What improvements after this version?
    1. Make the discord bot running in seprate program rather than built inside the program.
    2. the search gameid function is sometimes unexpectedly not working,will fix that after it.
    3. notice the user the lowest recorded price as well.
    4. make the GUI more fits author's asthetic.
    5. do a .exe or macOS package if fully done.
